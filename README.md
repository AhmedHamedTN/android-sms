android-sms
===========

With a 3 hour driving commute, its quite frustrating when you get an SMS message and are unable to read it (as you're a good, legal driver of course).

This simple app attempts to solve that problem.

The app consists of a single screen, with a button to "enable" and one to "disable"

Once enabled, any incoming SMS messages will be spoken out via text-to-speech, so you would hear the following :

`SMS received from James, message is: What time will you be home at?`



To avoid any embarassments, be sure to disable the app before attending meetings ;)
